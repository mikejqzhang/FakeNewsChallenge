{"body": "Fear not arachnophobes, the story of Bunbury's \"spiderman\" might not be all it seemed.\n\nPerth scientists have cast doubt over claims that a spider burrowed into a man's body during his first trip to Bali. The story went global on Thursday, generating hundreds of stories online.\n\nEarlier this month, Dylan Thomas headed to the holiday island and sought medical help after experiencing \"a really burning sensation like a searing feeling\" in his abdomen.\n\nDylan Thomas says he had a spider crawl underneath his skin.\n\nThomas said a specialist dermatologist was called in and later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a \"tropical spider\".\n\nBut it seems we may have all been caught in a web... of misinformation.\n\nArachnologist Dr Volker Framenau said whatever the creature was, it was \"almost impossible\" for the culprit to have been a spider.\n\n\"If you look at a spider, the fangs, the mouth parts they have, they are not able to burrow. They can't get through skin,\" he said.\n\n\"We thought it may have been something like a mite, there are a few different parasitic mites out there, which can sometimes look a bit like a spider. I can't think of any spider which could do this to a person.\"\n\nDr Mark Harvey from the Western Australian Museum agreed and said he found the case \"bizarre\".\n\n\"I must confess I was amazed because I've never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human, or indeed any mammal,\" he said.\n\n\"Spiders need air to breathe, they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs. Being under the skin of somebody, I would have thought they wouldn't have enough air to survive.\n\n\"Even if it was a mite, I've never seen anything like this. Even if it was an insect, I've never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this, so it really is a remarkable case.\"\n\nDr Harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends.\n\"We hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin. Then [the baby spiders] burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics,\" he said.\n\n\"None of those are true, they're just made up stories.\n\n\"They're not actually able to dig through the skin, that's why this case is so unusual. Some can burrow into soil, but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that.\"\n\nSomething which is true, according to Dr Harvey, is that certain arachnids do \"live on humans\".\n\n\"We all have mites living on our faces. They're follicle mites, but they're absolutely miniscule and you can't see them. We transmit them to our children when we have kids,\" he said.\n\n\"They live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin. Those mites are so small, you can't see them, and they're not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach.\"\n\nDr Framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender, dead or alive, and enlisting the help of experts.\n\n\"It would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it,\" he said.\n\n\"If you have been bitten by something, the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral.\"\n\nDylan Thomas has been contacted for comment.\n\n- WA Today", "body_id": "1923", "body_senti": [0.9808, 0.034, 0.879, 0.087], "cos_sim": 0.11518000817337339, "headline": "Tropical spider burrowed under man's skin through appendix scar and lived there for THREE DAYS", "headline_senti": [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0], "stance": "disagree"}

{"body": "Online retail giant Amazon.com Inc. AMZN -1.98%  plans to open its first brick-and-mortar store, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nThe site, set to open in time for the holiday-shopping season on Manhattan\u2019s busy 34th Street, would mark an experiment by Amazon to connect with customers in the physical world. Amazon has built its business on competitive pricing and fast shipping. Until now, though, it couldn\u2019t compete with the immediacy of a traditional store.\n\nAmazon\u2019s space at 7 West 34th St., across from the Empire State Building in Midtown, would function as a mini-warehouse, with limited inventory for same-day delivery within New York, product returns and exchanges, and pickups of online orders.\n\nOpening a physical location is \u201cabout marketing the Amazon brand,\u201d said Matt Nemer, a Wells Fargo analyst. \u201cSame-day delivery, ordering online and picking up in store are ideas that are really catching on. Amazon needs to be at the center of that.\u201d\n\nAmazon also may consider using the space to showcase inventory, particularly its devices like the Kindle e-readers, Fire smartphone or Fire TV set-top box, according to people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.\n\nOperating stores also carries risks. Until now, Amazon has largely avoided some costs associated with retailing, including leases, paying employees and managing inventory in hundreds of stores. Those expenses could imperil the company\u2019s already thin profit margins.\n\nSome details about the New York store couldn't be learned immediately, including the size, length of the lease or amount of inventory that would be housed there. People familiar with the matter cautioned that Amazon\u2019s plans could change, and that the store is an experiment and could be deemed unsuccessful.\n\nIf it is successful, however, the New York location could presage a rollout to other U.S. cities, according to the people familiar with the company\u2019s thinking.\n\nAmazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea, said another person familiar with the effort. Amazon once sold Kindles in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Target Corp. outlets, but those retailers pulled the devices from shelves two years ago in an apparent nod to Amazon\u2019s growing power in retailing.\n\nThe 12-story building on 34th Street, owned by Vornado Realty Trust, once housed an Ohrbach\u2019s department store and now has Mango and Express stores at street level. There are two loading docks at the back of the building.\n\nThe Amazon store will be in the shadow of the Empire State Building, which last year attracted 4.3 million visitors to its observatory. It is a block east of Herald Square, where Macy\u2019s Inc. flagship store draws more than 20 million annual visitors, according to the 34th Street Partnership, a business-improvement district.\n\n\u201cFoot traffic on 34th Street is unparalleled,\u201d said Chase Welles, executive vice president at SCG Retail, a real-estate service company.\n\nThe streetscape of 34th Street has changed dramatically since the 1990s, when it was populated by low-end retailers. Since then, the business-improvement district and area companies have spent about $2 billion on upgrades to the neighborhood and individual properties, according to the 34th Street Partnership. Global and national retailers such as Zara, Uniqlo and Vince Camuto have opened stores on the street.\n\nVornado Chief Financial Officer Stephen Theriot hailed the 34th Street building on a recent conference call with analysts. \u201cAs a former department store, it\u2019s got very high ceilings, it is got big, open floor plates, and that\u2019s the type of property that a lot of the creative class tenants\u201d favor, he said.\n\n\nAmazon has studied opening a brick-and-mortar outlet for years, even scouting locations in its hometown Seattle about two years ago before scrapping the idea. Bloomberg\nOrdering online with the option to pick up in stores has proved popular; retailers including Wal-Mart, Home Depot Inc. and Macy\u2019s, offer the service. Others employ delivery services such as Google Inc., eBay Inc. or startup Deliv Inc. to fetch orders from stores, rather than warehouses, and bring them to customers.\n\nAmazon has experimented with physical stores before, including pop-up shops and locations run by subsidiaries. Last November, Kindle-brand pop-ups appeared in U.S. malls, selling e-readers and tablets from vending machines. Its Zappos unit has a store near its Kentucky distribution center and once operated a few outlets in its hometown Las Vegas; and its Quidsi unit runs a cosmetics store in Manhasset, N.Y.\n\nAmazon also has set up large metal lockers in convenience stores and parking garages around the country, to accommodate deliveries and returns. The lockers don\u2019t offer same-day delivery, however. The lockers have been a popular option and Amazon has expanded them to a number of cities, including overseas, after initially just offering them in Seattle.\n\nAmazon took some inspiration from a trial by the U.K.\u2019s Home Retail Group PLC, allowing customers to order eBay goods online and pick them up in its Argos stores, said one person familiar with Amazon\u2019s thinking. By year\u2019s end Argos expects to provide the service at 650 stores from 65,000 eBay sellers.\n\nOther primarily online retailers have opened physical storefronts, including clothier Bonobos Inc., eyeglasses purveyor Warby Parker, and subscription beauty-products service Birchbox.\n\nNew York-based Bonobos opened its first of 10 retail stores in 2011; it plans 40 by 2016, said Chief Executive Andy Dunn. The stores offer limited inventory so customers can determine their size and choose styles and patterns; the merchandise is then shipped to their home from a warehouse, or can be collected later in-store.\n\nMr. Dunn said customers who order clothing from Bonobos brick-and-mortar stores spend roughly twice as much as online shoppers.", "body_id": "2116", "body_senti": [0.9911, 0.021, 0.907, 0.072], "cos_sim": 0.054144707069813613, "headline": "Video: Islamic State Claims to Have Captured US Weapons Airdrop Near Kobane", "headline_senti": [-0.4404, 0.209, 0.791, 0.0], "stance": "unrelated"}
